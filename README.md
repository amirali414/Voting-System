## Introduction

This documentation provides an overview of the smart contract code and its functionalities. The smart contract is written in Solidity, a programming language for developing Ethereum-based smart contracts.

## Smart Contract Overview

The Smart contract is named `Smart` and contains various functions and variables to manage a crowdfunding platform. It allows users to create projects, deposit funds, vote for projects, and select a winner based on the voting results.

## Contract Functions

### Ready

- Function: `Ready()`
- Description: Checks if the contract is ready for use.
- Test Cases: The function has several test cases to ensure the contract behaves as expected.

### Variables

- Function: `owner()`
- Description: Retrieves the address of the contract owner.
- Test Cases: The function has a test case to verify the retrieval of the owner's address.

- Function: `season()`
- Description: Retrieves the current season of the project.
- Test Cases: The function has a test case to verify the retrieval of the current season.

- Function: `uniqueId()`
- Description: Retrieves the unique ID of the project.
- Test Cases: The function has a test case to verify the retrieval of the unique ID.

- Function: `totalValue()`
- Description: Retrieves the total value of the project.
- Test Cases: The function has a test case to verify the retrieval of the total value.

- Function: `maximum()`
- Description: Retrieves the maximum value of the project.
- Test Cases: The function has a test case to verify the retrieval of the maximum value.

### Enums

- Enum: `State`
- Description: Defines the states of a project.
    - `Active`: Represents an active project.
    - `Win`: Represents a winning project.

### Deposit

- Function: `deposit()`
- Description: Deposits a certain amount of funds into the project.
- Test Cases: The function has test cases to verify the correct deposit amount and event logging.

### Withdraw

- Function: `withdraw()`
- Description: Withdraws a certain amount of funds from the project.
- Test Cases: The function has test cases to verify the correct withdrawal amount and event emission. It also checks for insufficient balance scenarios.

### Create Project

- Function: `createProject()`
- Description: Creates a new project and assigns ownership to the caller.
- Test Cases: The function has test cases to verify the creation of a new project and access control.

### Vote

- Function: `vote()`
- Description: Allows users to vote for a project.
- Test Cases: The function has test cases to verify voting from different users, checking votes, capital, and total value.

### Winner Selection

- Function: `winnerSelection()`
- Description: Selects the winner project based on the voting results.
- Test Cases: The function has test cases to verify the winner selection and associated variables.

## Events

The smart contract emits the following events:

- `LogCreated`: E

mitted when a new project is created.
- `LogDeposited`: Emitted when funds are deposited into a project.
- `LogWithdrawn`: Emitted when funds are withdrawn from a project.
- `LogVoted`: Emitted when a user votes for a project.
- `LogWinnerSelected`: Emitted when a winner is selected.

## Test Cases

The smart contract includes a comprehensive set of test cases to ensure proper functionality. The tests cover various scenarios, such as project creation, depositing and withdrawing funds, voting, and winner selection.
